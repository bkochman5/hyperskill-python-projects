# You are working on a task which requires you to add two numbers together.
# You have decided to encapsulate this operation in a function for reusable and organized code.
# You('ve written the necessary lines of code, but in the rush of things, they have been jumbled up.'
# Your task is to reorder the lines of code to create a valid Python function which takes two arguments,
# adds them together and then invoke the function and print the result.)
