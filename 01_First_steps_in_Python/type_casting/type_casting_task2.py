# The languages of the world are amazing! Programming languages too, but now we will talk about the human ones.
# In linguistics, repeating a word or part of it is called reduplication.
# This morphological phenomenon is found in different languages. Think for a second,
# and you will definitely come up with a couple of examples. Just to name a few: knock-knock, so-so, bye-bye.
#
# We have a full reduplication here since the entire word is repeated.
# That('s the mechanism we want you to implement. Print a word exactly 2 times. '
#      'The spelling rules vary across the globe, so do not separate the halves (that will be easy!).)

word = input()


print(word * 2)
